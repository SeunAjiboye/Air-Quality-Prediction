# APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING FOR AIR QUALITY PREDICTION
Air pollution is a critical global health issue, causing millions of premature deaths annually. This study aims to enhance air quality prediction through the application of advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, focusing on Delhi, India, a region severely affected by air pollution. Historical air quality data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and meteorological data from Visual Crossing's Weather Data Services were utilised.

The exploratory analysis of the data revealed several key findings about AQI trends from 2019 to 2023. Monthly AQI trends showed a cyclical pattern, worsening from November to January and improving slightly afterwards. Seasonal analysis indicated that winter had the highest AQI levels, signifying poor air quality, while the monsoon season had the lowest. Dominant pollutants contributing to AQI were primarily PM2.5, followed by PM10, indicating that particulate matter is a critical concern for air pollution. Efforts to improve air quality should focus on these months of the year and on reducing particulate matter concentrations, given their significant impact on AQI.
The project explores various models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). A novel hybrid RF-GRU model was proposed and developed, leveraging the strengths of RF in managing complex relationships and GRU in capturing temporal dependencies. The hybrid model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest R-squared (RÂ²). The results highlight the effectiveness of hybrid ML and DL models in accurately forecasting air quality, providing valuable insights for policy interventions to mitigate pollution impacts.
